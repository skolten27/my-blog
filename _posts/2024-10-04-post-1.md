<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post takes a dive into simple, yet powerful data visualization tools. We will explore using ggplot in R and how to use similar visualization tools using Python packages to accomplish the same thing.</p>

## Introduction  

There are many many packages to help make data visualization more powerful and accessible to all skill levels. These packages and methods may seem overwhelming at firt. Today, we are going to take a look at some of the most commonly used data visualization tools, walk through how to use each one and compare the results from using different pacakges to help you decide which package will be best for you on your next project!

We are going to be using the *Palmer Penguins* data set. This data set is commonly used and is great to show various possible variations without getting too complicated or having to wory about tidying data(We will save that for another post). To import the dataset:

{%- highlight python -%}
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head()
{%- endhighlight -%}

Let's take a look at the first few rows of this dataset so we get an idea of the format and variables
{%- highlight python -%}
penguins.head()
{%- endhighlight -%}
{% include penguins_table.html %}

## Scatter Plot

Looking at the data we have may different variables. To start out with some exploratory data analysis it can be helpful to compare several variables at once. A scatter plot is a great way to compare more than two variables using colors, shapes or sizes. Let's start by comparing bill length, bill depth, and species.

Let's first do this using the plotnine package. The plotnine package uses the same framework as ggplot2(the renouned R visualization framework)

{%- highlight python -%}
from plotnine import *
plot = (ggplot(penguins,
               aes(x='bill_depth_mm',
                   y='bill_length_mm',
                   color='species'))
        + geom_point()
        + labs(
            title="Bill depth and length",
            subtitle="Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
            x="Bill depth (mm)", y="Bill length (mm)",
            color="Species",
            caption="Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
        )
        + scale_color_manual(values=['#2E86C1', '#28B463', '#E74C3C'])  # Custom color scheme
        + theme_minimal())

print(plot)
{%- endhighlight -%}
![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/penguins_plot.png)

Notice how in the aesthetic(aes) we list our variables of interest and how they should be displayed on the plot(x-axis, y-axis, color). We could include additional variables by assigning variables to shape or size as well. We then specify the type of plot, in our case we want a scatterplot which we denote by the `geom_point` function. And then we have our labels(labs) there we can add in a title, label our axes, add a caption, and add the legend for the colors. we can then choose the colors we want using the `scale_color_manual function` and the `theme-minimal` function removes the background shade from the graph to make it more visually apealing and simple.

Now let's do this using `matplotlib`

{%- highlight python -%}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

color_map = {
    'Adelie': '#FC766AFF',  # Blue
    'Chinstrap': '#B0B8B4FF',  # Green
    'Gentoo': '#184A45FF'  # Red
}
colors = penguins['species'].map(color_map)
plt.scatter(penguins['bill_depth_mm'], penguins['bill_length_mm'], c=colors)
plt.title('Bill Depth and Length', fontsize=16)
plt.suptitle('Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins', fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel('Bill Depth (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Bill Length (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.figtext(0.9, 0.02, 'Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package', 
            horizontalalignment='right', fontsize=10)

plt.show()
{%- endhighlight -%}
