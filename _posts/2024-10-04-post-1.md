<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ata visualization is a cornerstone of data analysis, helping us understand patterns and insights that might not be immediately apparent. In this post, we’ll introduce you to three powerful yet user-friendly Python libraries— plotnine, matplotlib, and seaborn—that will make your visualizations stand out. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of when and how to use each of these tools to make your data come to life.</p>

## Introduction  

Visualizing data might seem intimidating with the myriad of tools available, but it doesn’t have to be! Whether you’re just getting started or looking to refine your skills, this guide will walk you through three popular data visualization libraries in Python. We’ll demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses by comparing them head-to-head with the Palmer Penguins dataset—an approachable dataset used widely for teaching and experimentation.

With this guide, you’ll learn how to create stunning visualizations with ease, helping you choose the right tool for your next project.

## The Data

We'll be using the *Palmer Penguins* data set gathered by the [Palmer Station Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). This dataset is clean, easy to use, and perfect for exploring different visualizations without getting bogged down by data preparation. To load the dataset, you can use the following code:

{%- highlight python -%}
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head()
{%- endhighlight -%}

Let's take a look at the first few rows of this dataset so we get an idea of the format and variables
{%- highlight python -%}
penguins.head()
{%- endhighlight -%}
{% include penguins_table.html %}

## Data Visualization

Looking at the data, we have many different variables. To start out with some exploratory data analysis it can be helpful to compare several variables at once. A scatter plot is a great way to compare more than two variables using colors, shapes or sizes. Today, lets use three of the most commonly used data visualization methods to create a scatter plot comparing bill length, bill depth, and species.

### Plotnine

Let's first do this using the `plotnine` package. The `plotnine` package uses the same framework as `ggplot2`(the renowned R visualization framework)

{%- highlight python -%}
from plotnine import *
plot = (ggplot(penguins,
               aes(x='bill_depth_mm',
                   y='bill_length_mm',
                   color='species'))
        + geom_point()
        + labs(
            title="Bill depth and length",
            subtitle="Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
            x="Bill depth (mm)", y="Bill length (mm)",
            color="Species",
            caption="Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
        )
        + scale_color_manual(values=['#1E88E5', '#FFB74D', '#43A047'])  # Custom color scheme
        + theme_minimal())

print(plot)
{%- endhighlight -%}
![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/penguins_plot.png)

Notice how in the aesthetic(`aes`) we list our variables of interest and how they should be displayed on the plot(x-axis, y-axis, color). We could include additional variables by assigning variables to shape or size as well. We then specify the type of plot, in our case we want a scatterplot which we denote by the `geom_point` function. And then we have our labels(`labs`) there we can add in a title, label our axes, add a caption, and add the legend for the colors. we can then choose the colors we want using the `scale_color_manual function` and the `theme-minimal` function removes the background shade from the graph to make it more visually appealing and simple.

### Matplotlib

Now let's do this using `matplotlib`, one of the most widely-used libraries for visualization.

{%- highlight python -%}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

color_map = {
    'Adelie': '#1E88E5',  
    'Chinstrap': '#FFB74D',  
    'Gentoo': '#43A047' 
}
colors = penguins['species'].map(color_map)
plt.scatter(penguins['bill_depth_mm'], penguins['bill_length_mm'], c=colors)
plt.title('Bill Depth and Length', fontsize=16)
plt.suptitle('Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins', fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel('Bill Depth (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Bill Length (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.figtext(0.9, 0.02, 'Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package', 
            horizontalalignment='right', fontsize=10)

plt.show()
{%- endhighlight -%}
![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/penguins_plot_matpltlib.png)

Let's breakdown what is happening in the code. The con when trying to great a scatter plot with multiple variables in `matplotlib` is the complexity required in the code to distinguish the third variable. Notice that we have to first create a color map dictionary and then use that dictionary to map the colors to the species. However, note how straightforward adding additional elements to the plot is using `matplotlib`. We simple use `plt.` and then specify what element of the chart we wish to edit and how we wish to edit it. We can specify additional attributes for each element such as fontsize. Unfortunately,  `matplotlib` does not have a built in function like `caption` in `plotnine` to show our source, but it isn't too hard to just add a custom text to the figure.

### Seaborn

Finally, let’s use `seaborn`, a library built on top of `matplotlib` that simplifies many aspects of visualization. Here’s how to create the same plot with `seaborn`:

{%- highlight python -%}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.scatterplot(
    data=penguins,
    x='bill_depth_mm',
    y='bill_length_mm',
    hue='species',
    palette=sns.color_palette(['#1E88E5', '#FFB74D', '#43A047'])
)
plt.title('Bill Depth and Length', fontsize=16)
plt.suptitle('Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins', fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel('Bill Depth (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Bill Length (mm)', fontsize=14)
plt.figtext(0.9, 0.02, 'Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package', 
            horizontalalignment='right', fontsize=10)

plt.show()
{%- endhighlight -%}
![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/penguins_plot_seaborn.png)

`Seaborn` streamlines the process by letting us use the `hue` parameter to automatically color the points by species. This approach is much simpler and more intuitive compared to manually creating a color map, as we had to do with `matplotlib`.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored three powerful Python libraries for creating scatter plots:
* `plotnine`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

Each has its strengths: `plotnine` offers simplicity and a grammar-based approach, `matplotlib` provides full customization, and `seaborn` combines ease of use with beautiful aesthetics. I hope this post has given you a good starting point to begin experimenting with these tools in your own projects.
