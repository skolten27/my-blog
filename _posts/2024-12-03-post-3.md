## Introduction
The financial market is a complex ecosystem, driven by countless factors that affect stock performance. Among these, earnings surprises—instances where a company's reported earnings significantly differ from analysts' expectations—play a pivotal role. These surprises can send stock prices soaring or plummeting, and understanding them offers a window into market behavior.

In our previous exploration, we focused on collecting and analyzing earnings and stock performance data. This laid the foundation for deeper insights, answering questions like:

* How do earnings surprises correlate with stock price changes?
* What patterns exist in trading volume leading up to and following earnings announcements?

Now, we take this a step further. In this post, we’ll highlight two key insights derived from the data and introduce an interactive Streamlit app designed to empower users to explore these trends themselves. Whether you're a market analyst, investor, or simply curious about financial data, this app brings the power of interactivity to uncover market dynamics.

With visualizations and tools at your fingertips, you can:
