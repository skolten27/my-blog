## Introduction
The financial market is a complex ecosystem, driven by countless factors that affect stock performance. Among these, earnings surprises—instances where a company's reported earnings significantly differ from analysts' expectations—play a pivotal role. These surprises can send stock prices soaring or plummeting, and understanding them offers a window into market behavior.

In our previous exploration, we focused on collecting and analyzing earnings and stock performance data. This laid the foundation for deeper insights, answering questions like:

* How do earnings surprises correlate with stock price changes?
* What patterns exist in trading volume leading up to and following earnings announcements?

Now, we take this a step further. In this post, we’ll highlight two key insights derived from the data and introduce an interactive Streamlit app designed to empower users to explore these trends themselves. Whether you're a market analyst, investor, or simply curious about financial data, this app brings the power of interactivity to uncover market dynamics.

With visualizations and tools at your fingertips, you can:

* Examine trading volume trends for popular stocks.
* Explore how earnings surprises impact stock prices on release dates.
* Filter data by custom ranges to discover hidden patterns.

Ready to dive into the data? Let’s uncover what earnings can teach us about market movements.

## Streamlit app

I have built a [Streamlit App](https://another-stat386-theme-zxmsxtwgpqfsrr52835epd.streamlit.app/) to help you explore deeper and new ideas in addition to those we will cover in this blog post. 

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Streamlit Overview.png)

On the left side there is a sidebar that will allow you to filter by year or stock ticker.

The tabs represent three different visualizations you can perform on the data.

The *Surprise vs Stock Price Change* visualization has some additional inputs you can change to help you narrow your focus on specific portions of the graph and hopefully be able to identify trends in the data.

There are notes and descriptions throughout the app that will help you navigate as you explore! Don't be intimidated and have some fun with the data!

## Insights

I want to highlight a few key insights the data reveals that may be helpful in guiding your own exploration of the data via my [Streamlit App](https://another-stat386-theme-zxmsxtwgpqfsrr52835epd.streamlit.app/)!

### Trading volume

While there is no single overarching pattern across all stocks of interest in the days before and after earnings release dates, a sub-trend emerges consistently across multiple stocks.

The trend: trading volume trends down several days after the earnings release date. Here is the plot demonstrating this trend for Tesla below:

The other plots all show downward trends for the last days as well. But don't take my word for it! Go on the app and explore the other stocks!

### Earnings Surprise

The other insight gained from these visualization that I wish to highlight is the effect the economy in general has on earning surprise.

For example, in boom year like 2023 the earnings surprise percentage was largely positive, meaning that these companies were largely earning more than analysts expected.

Now let's look at a pretty average year like 2019. Notice how these earnings surprise percentages are largely at or around 0.

Now, using my [Streamlit App](https://another-stat386-theme-zxmsxtwgpqfsrr52835epd.streamlit.app/)! see if you can find trends in other years. What might be causing those trends? Can you find any trends where earnings surprise percentages are largely negative?

## Conclusion

While my biggest takeaway from this analysis is that financial market data is much more complex and dependent on more variables than I imagined, there are still many valuable insights that can be gained from exploring the data. 

Let me know in the comments what other trends you found while exploring the data!
