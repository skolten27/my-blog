<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen companies release their quarterly earnings, investors and analysts closely watch the numbers. But how do these earnings actually impact stock prices?  In this post, we'll explore this question by scraping financial data using the Alpha Vantage API and analyzing it with Python. APIs are a powerful tool for data science, offering direct access to raw data from various sources. After reading, you'll have a solid grasp of practical API usage, data cleaning techniques, and how to uncover insights from real-world financial data—all using Python.</p>

## Do Earnings Announcements Impact Stock Prices?
The question I set out to answer was whether a company's earnings data influences its stock price. Earnings reports are released quarterly and are highly anticipated by investors. In this analysis, we focus on seven well-known companies from different industries, aiming to uncover patterns or trends in stock price changes surrounding their earnings announcements.
* WEN: Wendy's Company
* TSLA: Tesla, Inc.
* AAPL: Apple Inc.
* GOOG: Alphabet Inc. (Google)
* AMZN: Amazon.com, Inc.
* NFLX: Netflix, Inc.
* CRM: Salesforce, Inc.

## Using the API
Why Alpha Vantage?
While there are several APIs available for financial data, I chose Alpha Vantage due to its robust free-tier offering, user-friendly documentation, and availability of both time series and earnings data. However, the API does have limitations, such as a cap of 25 requests per day on the free plan, which required strategic data requests.

The [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) has a very helpful [documentation page](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation). Alpha Vantage's API terms are pretty loose as all of the data is publicly available so you are allowed to publish and share data gathered using the API. However, many APIs are not this way so be sure to read terms and conditions carefully

## Gathering the Data
The [documentation page](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation) breaks down each of the API options with their parameters and expected outputs. Most documentation pages will break down APIs similarly and is a great way to start when exploring an API. While Alpha Vantage didn't have an option that did exactly what I was hoping I was able to use two different options to gather the data necessary to answer my question. Be sure to follow all terms and conditions when using an API. 
<ol>
<li>The first API option I used was the **time series data**. This option returns the date, daily open price, daily high price, daily low price, daily close price, and the daily trade volume for each day(excluding weekends and holidays) since the stock's IPO(Initial Public Offering).The code below demonstrates how to make a GET request to the Alpha Vantage API for daily time series data. We loop through a list of stock symbols and collect the daily open, high, low, close, and volume data for each symbol. If the request fails (e.g., due to API limits), we log an error message.</li>
    {%- highlight python -%}
    all_price_data = []
    symbols = ['WEN', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'NFLX', 'CRM']

    for symbol in symbols:
        params = {
            'function': 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY',
            'symbol': symbol,
            'outputsize': 'full',
            'datatype': 'json',
            'apikey': apikey
        }
        results = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        if results.status_code == 200:
            price_data = results.json().get('Time Series (Daily)', {})
            for date, data in price_data.items():
                data['symbol'] = symbol
                data['date'] = date
                all_price_data.append(data)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to retrieve data for {symbol}")

    price_df = pd.DataFrame(all_price_data)
    price_df
    {%- endhighlight -%}
Here are a few rows from the price dataframe.
{% include price_table.html %}

<li>The second API option I used was the **earnings data**. This function returns the quarterly earnings per share data for the company of interest. Additionally this option returns the estimated earnings per share data, the surprise level(difference between acutal and estimated earnings), and the percentage surprise. The code to gather the earnings data is very similar to the code I used for price data so I won't bore you with repetition here.</li>
</ol>

Before joining the datasets, I performed some basic cleaning:

* Converted date columns to datetime format for easier time-based analysis.
* Removed any duplicate entries.
* Filtered the time series data to include only dates within one week before and after the earnings release date.
* Merged the cleaned datasets using an inner join on the stock symbol and date columns.

When joining, I included the time series data a week before and a week after the earnings date for each of the stocks to be able to measure what happens to the stocks leading up to and after the earnings date. A link to my full code to scrape, clean and join my data can be found at the end of this post.

## An Overview of the Data
Now let's do some exploratory data analysis to gain a more complete picture of the data and begin to understand how we can go about answering our question of how earnings affect stock prices. 

To answer our main research question, we first need to understand the trading patterns surrounding earnings release dates. We start by analyzing the trading volume, as increased volume often signals heightened investor interest. Additionally, we examine the relationship between earnings surprise (the difference between actual and expected earnings) and stock price changes to determine if unexpected results drive significant market reactions.

### Volume Surrounding Earnings Release Date
<p>The first graph we will look at will visualize the trading volume for the days leading up to and after the earnings release date.</p>

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/volume.png)

I am not a stock professional, however I am surprised that there is not a spike in trading volume closer to the earnings release date. Maybe on further analysis I will expand the day range before and after the earnings release date to see if the scope is too narrow to show any fluctuation in trade volume.

### Earnings Surprise
Surprise is the difference between the actual and expected earnings. I wanted to look into how accurate the expected earnings are. My theory behind this is that the more accurate the expected earnings the greater effect any surprise would have on stock prices.

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/surprisePercentageDensity.png)

It appears as though earnings are pretty accurate as the density plot is centered around 0 at the density is much higher around 0 than anywhere else. The distribution does appear to be right skewed.

### Surprise vs Stock Price Change
Ultimately I will want to look at other ways to explore the relationship between surprise and stock change but I wanted to start by creating a scatterplot comparing surprise percentage and percent change in stock price. 

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/earningsvspricechange.png)

The plot surprisngly seems to show the highest percent change in stock price around 0 percent earnings surprise. I think in further analysis I would want to focus on that area around 0 percent earnings surprise to see if the percent changes in stock price are occuring around smaller but still positive percent change in earnings(maybe around 10% or something). I would also explore excluding any extremely low stock prices that could be causing extreme percentage change in stock price.

## Wrapping it Up
As promised, [here is a link](https://github.com/skolten27/StockScrapingSimplified) to my complete code. 

From our initial analysis, it appears that the earnings surprise does not have a straightforward correlation with immediate stock price changes, particularly near zero percent earnings surprise. This finding suggests that other factors may influence price volatility, such as market sentiment or external economic conditions. In my next post, I plan to:

* Expand the date range for analysis to capture longer-term price movements.
* Investigate other financial indicators (e.g., P/E ratio, market cap) that might provide additional context.
* Apply machine learning techniques to predict stock price changes based on historical earnings data.
