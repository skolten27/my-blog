<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>PIs are a powerful tool for data science, offering direct access to raw data from various sources. In this post, we’ll dive into using the Alpha Vantage API to scrape stock market data, clean it, and analyze how earnings announcements affect stock prices. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of practical API usage, data cleaning techniques, and how to uncover insights from real-world financial data—all using Python.</p>

## How do earnings effect stock prices?
The question I set out to answer is how a companies earnings data effects their stock price. A company releases earnings data quarterly. Using Alpha Vantage API I was able to pull the earnings date for the following six companies: 
* WEN: Wendy's Company
* TSLA: Tesla, Inc.
* AAPL: Apple Inc.
* GOOG: Alphabet Inc. (Google)
* AMZN: Amazon.com, Inc.
* NFLX: Netflix, Inc.
* CRM: Salesforce, Inc.
I tried to get a mix of industries in the companies that we are analyzing.

## Using the API
The [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) has a very helpful [Documentation page](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation). You need to apply for a free API key before using the API and only certain options are avialble on the free version. With the free version you are only allowed 25 requests per day.

## Gathering the data
The [Documentation page](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation) breaks down each of the API options with their parameters and expected outputs. Most documentation pages will break down APIs similarly and is a great way to start when exploring an API. While Alpha Vantage didn't have an option that did exactly what I was hoping I was able to use two different options to gather the data necessary to answer my question. 
The first API option I used was the time series data. This option returns the date, daily open price, daily high price, daily low price, daily close price, and the daily trade volume for each day since the stock's IPO(Initial Public Offering).
The second API option I used was the earnings data. This function returns the quarterly earnings per share data for the company of interest. Additionally this option returns the estimated earnings per share data, the suprise level(difference between earnings and estimated earnings), and the percentage surprise.
I then cleaned these data sets to take only the columns I needed and joined them together. I included the time series data a week before and a week after the earnings date for each of the stocks to be able to measure what happens to the stocks leading up to and after the earnings date.
